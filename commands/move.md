Move `key` from the currently selected database (see `SELECT`) to the specified
destination database.
When `key` already exists in the destination database, or it does not exist in
the source database, it does nothing.
It is possible to use `MOVE` as a locking primitive because of this.

## ·µ»ØÖµ

@integer-reply, specifically:

* `1` if `key` was moved.
* `0` if `key` was not moved.
